<h3 style="color:black;">Introduction</h3>


<p>My name is Matthew Spreitzer I am a Computer Science major here with a concentration in software engineering. I really enjoy programming<br>
I have always enjoyed playing around with computers and building things and when I started to program it put those two things <br>
together and I have enjoyed it since I started taking it. I always enjoy the challenge a new project gives me but it is always <br>
rewarding when you finish it and you can sit back and admire what you accomplished. I have used what I learned in this major at my work<br>
being able to automate some of the tasks I have to do at my job has saved me alot of time and headache because they were not fun tasks.
<br>
<br>
I have a bother who attends Concordia University Wisconsin and a Sister who goes to Milwaukee School of Engineering <br>
My brother also studies computer science and my sister studies bio-medical engineering. My dad is a programming consultant and my mom <br>
works in oncology sales. My father was the reason I got into programming and the fun I have with it is the reason I stayed.

<h3 style="color:black;">What I hope to learn in this course</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A better understanding of HTML webpages and what goes into them including JS and CSS</li>
    <li>How you can host webpages with a server or other ways of opening them up to more people</li>
    <li>growing my rather limited knowledge of HTML, JS and CSS </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 style="color:black;">My favorite hobby</h3>
  <p>
      It is hard for me to pick a favorite hobby because my three main ones are lifting, video games and RC cars. But I think I need to pick <br>
      RC cars The reason I choose this is because I have always liked playing with the little cheap remote control cars but when I got into highschool <br>
      I started spotting powerlifting meets and was able to buy myself a nice 2 stroke gas RC car which I really enjoy for many reasons. The first is that <br>
      they are fun to use high end cars are pretty much small cars and have a lot of moving parts that you can tune and tinker with the get your car <br> 
      performing how you  want it to preform which is nice to mess around with. I also like that they are cheap to repair so I can bash them around and <br>
      if something breaks it is not the end of the world and I can fix it for fairly cheap.
